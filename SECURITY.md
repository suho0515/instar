# Security Policy

## Instar's Security Model

Instar runs Claude Code with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. Security is enforced through behavioral hooks, LLM-supervised safety gates, and network hardening rather than permission dialogs.

This is power-user infrastructure for developers who want genuine AI autonomy. If you need a sandboxed environment, Instar is not the right tool.

**Security layers:**
- Command guards block destructive operations (rm -rf, force push, database drops)
- Safety gates provide LLM-supervised review of external actions
- Network hardening: localhost-only API, CORS, rate limiting
- Audit trails via decision journaling
- Adaptive trust per service
