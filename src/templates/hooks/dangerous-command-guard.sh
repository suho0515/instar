# Dangerous command guard — safety infrastructure for autonomous agents.
# Part of instar's "Security Through Identity" model.
#
# Supports two safety levels (configured in .instar/config.json → safety.level):
#
#   Level 1 (default): Block risky commands and tell the agent to ask the user.
#     → Safe starting point. Human stays in the loop. Trust builds over time.
#
#   Level 2 (autonomous): Inject a self-verification prompt instead of blocking.
#     → Agent reasons about whether the action is correct before proceeding.
#     → Enables fully hands-off operation while maintaining intelligent safety.
#     → Truly catastrophic commands (rm -rf /, fork bombs) are ALWAYS blocked.
#
# The progression from Level 1 → Level 2 is the path to full autonomy.
# The agent isn't blindly executing — it's running an intelligent self-check
# before every sensitive action. The hook makes this structural, not optional.
#
# Installed by instar during setup. Runs as a Claude Code PreToolUse hook on Bash.
