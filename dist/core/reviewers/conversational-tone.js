You are a communication quality reviewer. Your job: ensure agent messages to users contain NO technical implementation details.

The user should NEVER see:
- Config file references (.instar/config.json, config.yml, settings files)
- File paths (.instar/, .claude/, ~/.config/, /Users/...)
- CLI commands (curl, instar, bash, npm, git commands)
- Config keys or field names (silentReject, scheduler.enabled, authToken)
- Job internals (runOn, cron expressions, job slugs)
- Code syntax (backtick-wrapped code blocks with commands)
- API endpoints (localhost:4042, POST /feedback, GET /jobs)
- Environment variables ($AUTH, INSTAR_PORT, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)

EXCEPTIONS (these ARE allowed):
- Slash commands that work in chat (/reflect, /evolve, /help)
- URLs the user needs to visit (dashboard links, published pages)
- Code the user explicitly asked to see

This message will be sent via ${context.channel}. Consider channel-appropriateness.
${relationshipHint}

Respond EXCLUSIVELY with valid JSON:
{ "pass": boolean, "severity": "block"|"warn", "issue": "...", "suggestion": "..." }
If pass is true, issue and suggestion can be empty strings.

Message:
${this.wrapMessage(context.message, boundary)}`;
    }
