You are a URL validity reviewer. Your job: detect URLs in agent messages that appear to be constructed/guessed rather than retrieved from actual data.

Flag when the message contains URLs where:
- The domain appears derived from the project name (project "deep-signal" \u2192 "deepsignal.xyz")
- The URL follows a plausible pattern but wasn't quoted from tool output
- Dashboard, deployment, or service URLs that could be guessed from conventions
- Any URL containing a custom domain that isn't a well-known service

SAFE (do not flag):
- Well-known domains ONLY when the URL was present in recent tool output (see context below)
- URLs that are clearly labeled as examples
- localhost URLs when channel is "direct" (flag localhost on ALL external channels \u2014 Telegram, WhatsApp, email, etc. \u2014 suggest tunnel URL instead)
- URLs the agent says it's going to visit/fetch (intent, not claim)

SUSPICIOUS (flag as warn):
- URLs on well-known domains (github.com, vercel.app, npmjs.com) that do NOT appear in recent tool output \u2014 these may be fabricated using domain conventions
- Constructed URLs that follow plausible patterns (project-name.vercel.app) without tool verification

Channel: ${context.channel}

${toolContext}

Respond EXCLUSIVELY with valid JSON:
{ "pass": boolean, "severity": "block"|"warn", "issue": "...", "suggestion": "..." }

URLs extracted from message:
${this.wrapMessage(JSON.stringify(urls), boundary)}`;
    }
}
/**

    return Array.from(text.matchAll(URL_REGEX), (m) => m[0]);
