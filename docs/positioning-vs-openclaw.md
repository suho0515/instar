## The One-Line Difference

**OpenClaw** is a multi-channel AI assistant framework. You deploy it, connect messaging platforms, and interact with an AI agent through conversations.

**Instar** is the fastest way to give a Claude Code agent a persistent body. Install it fresh on a bare machine, or add it to a project you've already been building. Either way, you get autonomy in minutes.

**OpenClaw asks:** "How can I be your AI assistant everywhere?"
**Instar asks:** "How can your Claude Code agent get a persistent body?"

## What Each Project Actually Is

### OpenClaw: An AI Assistant You Talk To

OpenClaw is a WebSocket gateway that connects an embedded AI agent (Pi SDK) to 20+ messaging platforms. You configure it, deploy it, and talk to your personal AI assistant across all your channels. Built by Peter Steinberger (@steipete), a well-known iOS developer. MIT licensed, active development.

**Key capabilities:**
- 20+ messaging channel adapters with deep per-channel configuration (DM policies, group policies, allowlists, media handling, chunking, streaming)
- Companion apps on macOS, iOS (internal preview), Android with voice wake and device execution
- SOUL.md bootstrap ritual — the agent co-creates its identity with you on first run
- Docker sandboxing (3 modes × 3 scopes × access levels) with tool policy profiles and security audit CLI
- ClawHub skill marketplace with vector search for discovery
- 50 bundled skills referenced (smart home, notes, dev tools, media — not individually documented)
- Multi-agent routing with deterministic priority hierarchy
- Hybrid memory search (BM25 + vector with MMR and temporal decay)
- Lobster workflow DSL for deterministic multi-step pipelines with approval gates
- 1000+ configuration fields with hot-reload, schema validation, env var substitution
- Auth profile rotation with failover (exponential cooldown, session stickiness)
- Browser automation (CDP + Playwright, AI-friendly snapshots, sandbox-aware containers)
- 12+ model providers with custom endpoint support

**The mental model:** OpenClaw IS the product. You deploy it, and it becomes your AI assistant.

### Instar: A Persistent Body for Any Claude Code Agent

Instar gives Claude Code agents the infrastructure to run autonomously. Two paths to the same outcome:

**Fresh install** — `npx instar init my-agent` creates a complete project from scratch: identity files, configuration, hooks, jobs, and a persistent server. Your agent is running in under a minute.

**Existing project** — `cd my-project && npx instar init` adds autonomy infrastructure to what you've already built, without touching your existing code.

**Key capabilities:**
- Persistent server managing Claude Code sessions via tmux
- Cron-based job scheduler with quota-aware gating and model tiering
- Identity system (AGENT.md, USER.md, MEMORY.md) with hooks that enforce continuity across compaction
- Telegram integration as a real-time control plane (every job gets its own topic)
- Relationship tracking across all channels and platforms (cross-platform identity resolution, significance scoring)
- Behavioral hooks (session-start identity injection, dangerous command guards, grounding before messaging, compaction recovery)
- Auth-secured HTTP API for session/job/relationship management
- Health watchdog with auto-recovery
- Default coherence jobs that ship out of the box (circadian rhythm)
- Full self-evolution: agent modifies its own jobs, hooks, skills, config, and infrastructure
- ToS-compliant: spawns real Claude Code CLI, never extracts OAuth tokens

**The mental model:** Instar gives any Claude Code project a body — whether that project existed before or starts right now.

## The Architectural Divide

### Runtime: API Wrapper vs. Development Environment

**OpenClaw** wraps the Claude API (via Pi SDK) to create an agent that responds to messages. The agent has tools (bash, read, write, edit), but it's fundamentally a **message-response loop** — users send messages, the agent processes them, the agent responds.

**Instar** runs on Claude Code — Anthropic's full agentic development environment. Each session is a complete Claude Code instance with:
- Extended thinking
- Native tool ecosystem (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep, WebSearch, WebFetch)
- Sub-agent spawning via Task tool (with model-tier selection: Opus/Sonnet/Haiku)
- Hook system (pre/post tool execution, session lifecycle)
- Skill system (slash-command workflows)
- Context management with automatic compaction
- MCP server integration (Playwright, Chrome extension, etc.)

The difference: OpenClaw's agent executes tools through an API. Instar's agent IS a development environment.

### Session Model: Single Gateway vs. Multi-Session Orchestration

**OpenClaw** runs a single gateway process. All conversations route through one WebSocket server with one embedded agent. Multiple agents are supported through routing rules, but each agent is still a single process.

**Instar** manages multiple independent Claude Code sessions, each running in its own tmux process. The server orchestrates which sessions run, monitors their health, respawns them when they die, and coordinates through Telegram topics and event logs.

This means Instar can run 5 jobs simultaneously — one doing a health check, one processing emails, one engaging on social media, one running reflection, one responding to a Telegram message — each as an independent Claude Code instance with full capabilities, its own context window, tools, and state.

### Identity: Co-Created Persona vs. Earned Infrastructure

**OpenClaw's SOUL.md** is elegant. On first run, the agent and user have a bootstrap conversation: "Who am I? Who are you?" The result is a self-authored identity file the agent can modify over time. It's personal and charming.

**Instar's identity system** goes deeper — it's not just the files, it's the infrastructure that keeps identity alive:
- **AGENT.md**: Core identity (like SOUL.md), with thesis explanation of why identity matters
- **USER.md**: Understanding of the primary user
- **MEMORY.md**: Accumulated learnings and context
- **Behavioral hooks**: Identity is re-injected on every session start and after every context compaction
- **Grounding before messaging**: Before any external communication, the agent re-reads its identity files
- **Self-evolution**: The agent can update its own identity files, create new skills, write new hooks, and modify its own configuration

The difference isn't the identity file — it's the infrastructure that keeps identity alive across context compressions, session restarts, and autonomous operation. OpenClaw's identity is something the agent tries to remember. Instar's identity is something the infrastructure guarantees. Structure over willpower.

### Memory: Conversation Logs vs. Relational Understanding

**OpenClaw's memory** is sophisticated for retrieval — hybrid BM25 + vector search with MMR for diversity, temporal decay with configurable half-life, multiple embedding providers, and an auto-flush mechanism before compaction. This is genuine information retrieval engineering.

**Instar's memory** is relationship-centric rather than conversation-centric:
- Cross-platform identity resolution (same person on Telegram and email → merged)
- Per-person relationship records with interaction history and topic extraction
- Significance scoring derived from frequency, recency, and depth
- Context injection before interactions (the agent "knows" who it's talking to)
- Stale relationship detection

OpenClaw remembers conversations. Instar understands relationships. Different optimization targets — OpenClaw optimizes for retrieving relevant past context, Instar optimizes for understanding the humans in its world.

### Security: Sandboxing vs. Structural Guardrails

**OpenClaw's security** is designed for multi-user, untrusted environments:
- Docker sandbox (3 modes × 3 scopes × access levels)
- Tool policy profiles (minimal/coding/messaging/full)
- DM pairing with temporary codes and expiry
- Loop detection (generic repeat, poll-no-progress, ping-pong)
- `security audit --fix` CLI for self-checking
- Prompt injection mitigation docs and incident response procedures

**Instar's security** is designed for single-user, trusted environments with structural identity protection:
- Dangerous command guards (blocks `rm -rf`, force push, database drops)
- Identity re-injection after every compaction (the agent can't "forget" its boundaries)
- Grounding before external communication (prevents identity drift in public)
- User permissions model (appropriate for developer + their agent)

Different threat models. OpenClaw defends against untrusted users and external attackers. Instar defends against context loss, identity drift, and the agent's own training biases.

## What Instar Does That OpenClaw Doesn't

### 1. Works Both Ways: Fresh Install or Augment Existing

OpenClaw IS the AI assistant. You deploy OpenClaw, and that's your product.

Instar works two ways:
- **Fresh:** `npx instar init my-agent` — complete project from scratch. Running in under a minute.
- **Existing:** `cd my-project && npx instar init` — adds autonomy without touching your code.

### 2. Full Claude Code Runtime

Every Instar session is a real Claude Code process with extended thinking, native tools, sub-agents, hooks, skills, and MCP servers. Not an API wrapper — the full development environment.

### 3. Multi-Session Orchestration

Multiple independent Claude Code sessions running in parallel. Not one gateway routing messages — independent agents with their own context, tools, and state.

### 4. Identity That Survives Context Death

Hooks that re-inject identity on session start, after compaction, and before messaging. The infrastructure guarantees identity persistence — the agent doesn't have to try to remember.

### 5. Deep Relationship Tracking

Cross-platform identity resolution, significance scoring, context injection, stale detection. Relationships are infrastructure, not conversation logs.

### 6. Full Self-Evolution

The agent modifies its own jobs, hooks, skills, config, and infrastructure. Not just workspace files — the system itself. "Let me build that capability" instead of "I can't do that."

### 7. Job-Topic Coupling

Every scheduled job gets its own Telegram topic. The group becomes a living dashboard of agent activity, organized by job. Auto-recreated if accidentally deleted.

### 8. Default Coherence Jobs

Ships with health checks, reflection triggers, and relationship maintenance. The agent has a circadian rhythm out of the box.

### 9. ToS Compliance

Spawns the real Claude Code CLI. Never extracts, proxies, or spoofs OAuth tokens. Works today without violating Anthropic's terms.

## What We Should Learn From Them

These aren't features to copy — they're patterns worth studying:

1. **DM pairing flow** — Temporary codes with 1-hour expiry for onboarding new contacts. Elegant for multi-user scenarios if Instar expands there.

2. **Auth profile rotation with failover** — Two-stage failover (rotate auth within provider, then model fallback) with exponential cooldown and session stickiness. More robust than simple account switching. Directly applicable to Instar's quota management.

3. **Security audit CLI** — `openclaw security audit --fix` scans for inbound access issues, tool blast radius, network exposure, browser control, disk permissions, and auto-remediates. An `instar security audit` could check identity file integrity, hook coverage, permission exposure.

4. **Streaming chunker** — Code-fence-aware text chunking with break preference hierarchy (paragraph > newline > sentence > whitespace > hard break). Nice UX detail for Telegram message formatting.

5. **Device pairing as execution endpoints** — The concept of companion devices that expose camera, location, commands to the agent. Novel architecture worth watching.

6. **Loop detection** — Generic repeat detection, poll-no-progress detection, ping-pong detection. Prevents the agent from getting stuck in unproductive cycles. Instar could use this for session health monitoring.

---

## What We Should NOT Worry About

- **Matching 20+ channels.** That's their core product, not ours. Telegram + Slack + Discord covers Instar's developer users. Channel breadth is OpenClaw's moat — don't fight on their terrain.

- **Native device apps.** Cool and novel, but tangential to "give your agent a body." Instar's users are developers at terminals, not consumers wanting AI on their phone.

- **Skill marketplace.** Our agents create their own skills — that's the entire thesis. A marketplace optimizes for distribution. Self-creation optimizes for autonomy.

- **Voice wake / TTS.** Nice-to-have, not core to persistent autonomy. If it matters later, it's an adapter — not a fundamental architecture change.

- **1000+ config fields.** Their configuration depth reflects their problem space (routing across 20+ channels to multiple agents). Instar's config is simpler because the problem is simpler. Don't add complexity to match a different product's complexity.

---

## Strategic Summary

### The Category Difference

These aren't competitors. They serve different needs in different categories:

- **OpenClaw** = messaging middleware. Get AI into every channel, make it feel personal, keep it secure. Value: **ubiquity** and **personality**.
- **Instar** = autonomy infrastructure. Give any Claude Code project a persistent body. Value: **autonomy** and **persistence**.

The overlap is: "both run an AI agent that talks to you on Telegram." Beyond that, they diverge completely.

### The Honest Gap

More messaging channels and voice. That's it. And it's a gap we choose not to close fully, because it's not our category.

### The Honest Advantage

Everything else:
- Runtime depth (full Claude Code vs API wrapper)
- Multi-session orchestration (parallel agents vs single gateway)
- Identity infrastructure (structural guarantees vs file the agent tries to remember)
- Self-evolution (modify the system itself vs modify workspace files)
- Relationship tracking (understand humans vs log conversations)
- ToS compliance (works today without violating Anthropic's terms)

### The Sharpest Weapon

"Different tools for different needs. But only one of them works today."
