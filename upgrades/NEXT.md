## What Changed

Fixed three critical WhatsApp setup bugs:

1. **Baileys peer dependency resolution**: Replaced `require.resolve()` with dynamic `import()` for detecting Baileys. The old approach failed in npx contexts because `require.resolve()` resolves relative to the npx cache directory, not the user's project. All detection points now try both v6 (`@whiskeysockets/baileys`) and v7 (`baileys`) package names.

2. **405 infinite reconnect loop**: When WhatsApp returns HTTP 405 (usually meaning the Baileys version is outdated and WhatsApp changed its protocol), the backend now logs a clear upgrade message and stops — no reconnection attempts. Previously this caused an infinite reconnect loop.

3. **Dashboard QR polling silent failures**: The dashboard's QR code polling previously swallowed errors silently. Now surfaces 401/403 auth failures, HTTP errors with status codes, and network connection errors visibly in the UI.

Added 22 regression tests covering all three issues.

## What to Tell Your User

- **WhatsApp setup reliability**: "WhatsApp pairing should work much more smoothly now — we fixed several issues that could cause the setup to fail silently or get stuck in loops."
